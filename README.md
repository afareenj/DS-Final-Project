This Shiny App takes raw EyeLink data sets in the form of MAT files, parses saccades and their peak velocities to produce saccade amplitude-vigor profiles for comparison of saccadic motor behavior between the data sets, and also allows visual display of the position data.  
System Requirements: This app requires installing the shiny, rmatio, signal, pracma, and ggplot2 libraries in R.
